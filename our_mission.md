Hi! My name is Jorge Coca, and I am the main organizer of the Chicago Flutter Meetup. 

Our goal with these events is to create a friendly environment in Chicago for everyone who is interested in learning and working with Flutter.

We want to build an space where everyone, regardless of their experience with Flutter or any other technology, feels empowered to keep growing as a technologist and member of the community.
