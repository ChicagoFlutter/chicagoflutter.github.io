In an effort to keep improving our community's harmony, we have published our [Code Of Conduct](https://chicagoflutter.com/code_of_conduct.html).

As a member of the community, you must adhere to this code of conduct, and be an ambassador at the same time. Respecting these values is the only we have to ensure a healthy group where everyone feels welcomed, and their voices are heard.

Thank you all for your hard work and enthusiasm!
